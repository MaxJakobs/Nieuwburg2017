The script "oocyteAnalyser.m" takes the output of the plusTipTracker package and gives the angles of each comet with respect to a drawn oocyte axis from anterior to posterior.

Usage:

1: Analyse movie with the plusTipTracker package
2: start script and select topfolder containing all analysed movies (the script searches for subfolders beginning with roi_* as generated by plusTipTracker).
3: A file named OOCYTEoutput.mat will be generated in each roi_* track subfolder with a variety of extracted values.

Note that the plusTipTracker package and the Image Processing Toolbox have to be installed to run the script. Tested on Matlab 2014a.
